Project Narrated Description: Fix My Code Challenge

Welcome to the Fix My Code Challenge project, where the aim is to delve into existing code bases and resolve issues. This project offers an opportunity to debug and improve code, with various tasks spanning different programming languages and frameworks.

Background Context:
The Fix My Code Challenge introduces a unique approach to projects. Participants are tasked with examining existing codebases, identifying issues, and rectifying them. This project is entirely optional and serves as an opportunity to enhance coding skills while contributing to personal grades positively. The primary objective is to fix issues within the provided code rather than rewriting entire sections.

Requirements:

    Editors Allowed: Participants can utilize vi, vim, or emacs for editing.
    Compilation Environment: All files must compile on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
    File Formatting: All files should conclude with a new line.
    README.md: A README.md file is mandatory at the project's root folder.

Tasks Overview:

Task 0: Server Status

    Description: A Flask project is underway, and the first step is establishing a route for the API's status, crucial for a load balancer implementation. However, the provided code for this functionality isn't working as expected. Debugging and fixing are necessary.
